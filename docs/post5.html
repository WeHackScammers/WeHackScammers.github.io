                        <div>
                            If you are just getting into scambaiting, the easiest thing to do is just call scammers and
                            mess around with them. If you want to collect information from them, it gets a little more
                            complicated. But where you start getting into potentially dangerous territorial is when
                            scammers start to try and control your computer. This is particularly relevant and is how
                            they make even more money off you. They show you some innocuous error messages and claim
                            your computer is riddled with malware and that you need to buy their malware cleanup
                            tool/service. This is of course not true, and their malware cleanup tools are usually just
                            malware themselves. These can be some fun scammers to mess with, but you need to be very
                            careful with how you screenshare.
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            Obviously, you do not want to let scammers onto your real computer, the usual answer for
                            this is to use a Virtual Machine (VM). We have discussed methods of this in previous
                            articles, but I am going to talk about some specifics. Our preferred VM client is VMWare,
                            but you can use any that you want.
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            The absolute number 1 priority with VMs is security. It doesn't matter how realistic your VM
                            is, if it leaks your information or somehow makes you unsafe and vulnerable to scammers, it
                            is a bad VM. It is a good idea to disable all the helpful tools that VM companies have to
                            make them easier to use. For example, you can frequently setup shared filesystem between the
                            host machine and the VM, or even share your clipboard so you can copy and paste between the
                            two. When it comes ot setting up a secure VM, these are both a bad idea. They open up more
                            avenues of attack for a skilled scammer to hack your computer and/or escape the VM. VM
                            escapes are not common, and the known vulnerabilities get patched very quickly, but it's the
                            unknown vulnerabilities that are scary.
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            The next step, which is just crucial as making sure scammers can't hack out of the VM is to
                            make sure there are no identifying pieces of personal information in the VM. Everything from
                            the username that shows on the screen to the timezone you are currently in is a potential
                            piece of information a dedicated scammers could put together to identify you. The less
                            information they have about you, the better.
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            Once you have a secure machine, the optional step is to remove any indication you are
                            running in a VM. This is very difficult to do. VMs essentially work the way the name
                            suggests, they <b>virtual</b>ize everything. Your VM does not have a real display, it has a
                            virtual display. That means that the device driver that translate softwatre signals to the
                            hardware for your display also must be virtual, so that software can run unmodified.
                            Typically, these device drivers have names like "VMWare Display Driver Version X.Xx". An
                            experienced scammer will pick up on this very quickly and realize you are running inside a
                            VM. To combat this, you can to certain extents rename these drivers to something more
                            generic. All you are changing is the display name, so it shouldn't impact the functionality
                            of your VM.
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            You can modify these display by trolling through the Window's Registry and changing anything
                            VM specific to generic. <b>BE VERY CAREFUL</b> while doing this, as messing the wrong thing
                            up in the Registry could brick your computer. Definitely do not do this on your host machine
                            unless you really know what you are doing, in the VM the risk is slightly lower because if
                            you mess up the worst that happens is you delete the VM and start over. It's a pain, but
                            it's better than destroying your real computer.
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            There are many tutorials out there to make your VM more secure and undetectable, I leave
                            finding these to you. The last thing I will leave you with is the extra step we take to be
                            even more secure. We do not run VMs on our real host machines, we have an old laptop that
                            serves the sole purpose of being a host machine for our VMs. This provides another layer of
                            protection between the scammers and our precious data.
