                        <ul>Condition: One must, in advance of its creation, be very clear in declaring they have no intention of using it for illegal activities, or else it can be ruled as a premeditated crime</ul>
                        <ul>Warning: If one is found to be suspected of a DIFFERENT crime, a warrant can be placed to collect all of an individual’s technology, along with their login credentials. If malware (or illegally obtained information) is found on the device IRREGARDLESS OF ITS RELEVANCE TO THE CASE IN WHICH THE WARRANT WAS SERVED, then being in its possession can be punishable</ul>

                        <br>

                        <div>
                            <b>Scambaiting</b>
                        <br>
                        <ul>Recording Calls (Wiretapping): Depends</ul>
                        
                        <ul>Explanation of Inter-State Laws: Individual state laws are different, and the law that holds the MOST protection of privacy is the law that is enforced. There are 11 states that require two-part (all participants) consent. In the case where a call is being made across state lines, IN MOST CASES the law of the state in which the recording device is located is the law that is used (though it is recommended to always assume the more restrictive law)</ul>
                        <br>
                        <ul>Explanation of International Laws: Similar to state laws, each country is different. Most countries allow some form of recording, normally under a “reasonable assumption of privacy”, meaning that if the conversation was held in a context that it was assumed no other parties were listening (home alone, business/financial call, etc) then it not allowed to be recorded without two-party consent. Each country has different definitions of “reasonable assumption of privacy”
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <ul>Exception: Most wiretapping laws are allowed to be ignored if a government institution is pursuing an investigation
                        </ul>
                        <ul>Warning: Almost all of these laws are under the assumption that a participant of the call is doing the recording and ONLY using the recording for themselves. Once a third party is doing the recording OR RECEIVING THE INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE RECORDING, then many of the aforementioned laws are no longer applicable as most places do not allow third party wiretapping, even when all involved parties give consent</ul>
                        <br>
                        <ul>Phishing/Social Engineering: Illegal</ul>
                        
                        <ul>Explanation: The acquisition of personal information or credentials from an individual without their consent/under false pretenses is considered fraud and can be severely punished
                        </ul>
                        
                        <ul>Exception: While one CANNOT trick scammers into providing any personal information, one can still “mess” with them if their intention is not to gain information (i.e., one can use a fake bank account website to see how a scammer interacts with it, but CANNOT have a fake login where a scammer’s login credentials would be tracked)
                        </ul>
                        
                        <ul>Warning: If one acquires personal information by accident (i.e. the scammer accidently provides their login credentials), then the individual is not allowed to use the credentials OR POSSES THEM. The usage/possession of another’s credentials without their consent, even if given to someone directly, is considered illegal and they are expected to delete them
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <ul>Prank Calls: Depends</ul>
                        
                        <ul>Explanation: Technically, by pretending to be a potential victim and wasting a scammer’s time, one is “prank calling” scammers. There are no direct laws relating to prank calls, however, people can be charged for harassment and even hate crimes IF WHAT IS SAId ON THE CALLS QUALIFIES. Essentially, so long as someone is not cursing, threatening, or “teasing” them in relation to their ethnicity, religion, or any other physical attribute, then there is no direct legal repercussions on the basis of “prank calling”
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        
                        </div>

                        <div>
                        <b>Reporting</b>
                        
                        <ul>Giving Information to a Third Party: Depends</ul>
                        
                        <ul><u>Explanation:</u> As mentioned previously, if the information obtained is done so under the assumption that it is for personal use (recorded calls), one is not allowed to involve a third party unless that person feels someone is at immediate risk of physical harm. If information was obtained legally or simply from observations, then it’s fine to report it to proper authorities</ul>
                        <ul><u>Exception:</u> For the FBI in particular (other government agencies and local police also have this option), there are anonymous reporting sites where people can provide information for authorities to have/act on</ul>

                        <div>
                            <b><u>Other Important Notes:</u></b>
                            <ul>Ignorance is often not a good enough excuse for cybercrimes, since the laws are newer, they prefer to make it stricter rather than risk loopholes
                            </ul>
                            <ul>There are ways of protecting oneself but most of them require the assistance of a lawyer or liability insurance, both of which cost money
                            </ul>
                            <ul>However, violators are only liable for damages if the victim chooses to press charges (which in this case would mean the scammer’s would have to admit they themselves were breaking the law)
                            </ul>
                            <ul>In terms of where someone can be punished for breaking cyber laws: (state means country as well) https://www.quora.com/Is-it-illegal-to-hack-a-scammers-computer
                            </ul>
                            <ul>In the state where you planned the action (only punishable for planning here)
                            </ul>
                            <ul>In the state where you conducted the action
                            </ul>
                            <ul>In the state of your citizenship
                            </ul>
                            <ul>In the state of the victim's citizenship</ul>
                            <ul>If the action (or the planning of the action) was not illegal at the time of conduction in the aforementioned places, then you're not punishable anywhere</ul>

                            <ul>In the US, federal law dictates one-party consent is needed to record a call (some states require all party consent and the state that has the law that favors more privacy is the law that is used, however it is often only punishable in the state the recording device was).
