                        <div>
                            Now that you know the basics, let's dive into the details of how to increase efficency to catch as many scammers as possible. Although we are fond of doing things from scratch, on this blog post we will take you through a new and easy process of scam-baiting. 
                            
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            The new process we have recently transitioned to, is BobRTC (via BaitArmy). BobRTC is a free calling service for people who help fight telephone fraud, illegal robocalls, and other forms of phone scams. All the tools we have been previosuly using, are integrated within the BobRTC platform, such as VPN, VoIP, phone numbers (replacing scammer.info) and audio recording, making it one easy stop for everything.
                            Here are some of the things you should know before joining the BaitArmy community:

                            <ol style="margin-block-start: 1em; margin-block-end: 1em; margin-inline-start: 1em;">
                                <li>Registration</li>
                                <li>Cool features</li>
                                <li>Benefits</li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            Registration for the BObRTC platform must be completed on the BaitArmy website. Due to size of the community that participates in scam-baiting, registration times are limited and/or happen during specific hours. An easy way to check is by going to the registration page and verify the open registration times in the bottom of the page.

                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            Configuring your BobRTC account entails setting up the audio depending on how you plan on using the account. For instance you can set the audio up so that scammers can hear you, or just block the audio and use sound effects (more on this on the next section). 
                            Enabling recordings on the preferences will enable all calls to be recorded, make sure to do that to replay your remarkable scam-baiting calls.
                            Some of our favorite BobRTC features are:
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            BaitArmy Chat- here we can chat with fellow BaitArmy members who often share their scam-baiting experience and provide context for specific phone numbers.
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        </div>
                            Phonebook- The phonebook is a large directory of known scam numbers on BobRTC, saving us the time of manually searching for them on the internet.
                        </div>  
                        <br>    
                        </div>
                            XP & Call Tokens- BobRTC uses a point system called XP (Experience Points). You can gain these points by getting phone calls to last more than 47 seconds. Gaining a certain amount of XP can give you access to features such as adding numbers to the phonebook, replying to the Central Forums, calling internationally, and a special badge on your username.
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        </div>      
                            Buddies & Sound Effects- This is our favorite feature. The Dial Codes button opens a list of commands for activating Buddies and sound effects when connected. Some of the buddies/Sound effects we have used so far that worked well are: Lenny - An old man who is hard of hearing; and the "Under Da Water" sound effect.

                        </div>
                        <br>
                        </div>
                            There's a lot of benefits in using BobRTC. BobRTC is secure and a condensed platform which provides all the security features for a succesful scam-baiting call. Additionally, BobRTC organizes scam types by various categories, making it easier to find a target. Most importantly, the platform has a "report Scams" sections which makes it easier to report the target. 
                        </div>

                        <br>
                        <div>
                            One more thing: BobRTC supports unlimited calling and dynamic phone numbers which means, if you have a favorite scammer you can keep waisting their time all day :)
